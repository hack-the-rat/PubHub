# PubHub 100

=======================================================

This is a dynamic web application that displays a webpage to a user, makes use of Java servlets for accessing information, and utilizes postgreSQL to create, read, update and delete information from a database.

The website's goal is to create a platform for authors to easily publish a book and for readers to access a book using various search functions such as book specific details or tags associated with certain books.

The project offers the challenge to develop both the front and back end of the application.

In PubHub 100, the developer was given a starting base project. The developer's task was to create a tagging system for the books. A user should be able to create, remove, update, and delete tags from books while maintaining the functionality of updating book details as well. A user should also be able to search for books using a given tag.

To make it work, we need to have a web server and a database established. I used JBoss tools for the server and posgreSQL for a database.

I created a system of tags so that a user can see all tags currently in the database as well as access a list of books containing a given tag. An author will be able to update the tags for a certain book by simply checking check boxes or by writing in a custom text.

This process took a span of approximately one month. The application still lacks a proper marketplace and social media implementation.
